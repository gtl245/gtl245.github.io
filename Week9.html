			<h1> Web 2.0 and Web Squared Response </h1>
		<br>
	

			<p>
       In the readings, " What is Web 2.0? " and " Web Squared " by Tim  O ' Reilly and John Battelle, we learn about how the web has evolved and changed from when it was first created to how we know it today. The web has grown to give more power to the user, whether it’s user-generated sites like Wikipedia, sites for easy communication like social media and Facebook, or multi-device softwares that make life convenient for the user. It’s interesting to see how restrictive the web was when it was first created, as it was only a way for users to view information, and compare it to now where the web encourages user generated content. It was funny to find that I didn’t recognize most of the listed sites from Web 1.0 in the reading; it goes to show how drastic the web changed with time. I see Web 2.0 to be the turning point where users are trusted and given the power to create and contribute to an identity through the web. We now currently live in the Web Squared era which amplified the ideas from Web 2.0 to the max. It entails AI, machine learning, virtual reality, and an increase in user participation. With this sudden surge of advancements, it makes me think of the possibility of going too far with the power of the web in the future. When should we stop? Based off these readings, I don’t think improvements in the web will ever stop. What if machines become so advanced that they are able to think for themselves without the user at all? It’s bit scary to think about, but yet again, I don’t know what the future has in store for us. Overall, I’m excited and scared to see how the web continues to progress and change in my lifetime.
