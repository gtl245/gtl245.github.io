				<h1 class = "about"> About</h1><img class = nai src="nai.jpg" width = 30%><p>This is a picture of my Nai Nai and Mom, the two strongest women I know. <br> <br>As a Second-Generation American, I don't connect to my Asian roots as much as I want to; this includes talking to my Nai Nai (Grandma) and Ye Ye (Grandpa) who both lived in Taiwan. And although I couldn't see or communicate with them often due to language barriers, my Mom always told me stories about my Gradparents as they went through World War II. Their stories were inspiring and beautiful, and with the recent death of my Nai Nai earlier this year in 2019, I wanted to create a project that not only remembered her, but also allowed me to share her stories with other people. <br><br> Using hand-drawn graphics and code, I present a short immersive, interactive, story-telling website, "Memoirs of My Nai Nai".</p></center>
