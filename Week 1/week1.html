		<p>The video, ‚ÄúWays of Seeing‚Äù, discusses how paintings and their original meanings have slowly changed and morphed throughout history due to mass reproduction, new technologies, and the way artworks are presented in various settings. Whether we‚Äôre viewing an artwork through a computer screen or whether there‚Äôs background music playing, the way an artwork is perceived will always differ from one person to the next. Through multiple reproductions and different perspectives of artworks, the original meaning and intention of the artwork is often lost in translation as new meanings are built upon individual interpretations.

		Relating this to web design, I believe that websites can also be perceived differently to people based on the context in which the website is being used upon. As a web designer, you have an important role to relay the function of your website in a clear and concise format so that users will immediately know what your intentions are because just like with paintings, millions of people surf the web everyday on the same sites and each one of those people use these sites for various purposes. I will definitely keep this in mind when I design my own website.
