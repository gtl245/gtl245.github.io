			After reading, "As We May Think" and "Long Live the Web", I was surprised to learn how accurate Bush's predictions of the creation of the internet were despite the fact that the technology did not exist when he wrote this article. He was correct in that the concept and creation of the internet did pave the way to efficient and effective communication and information sharing that the world has never seen before. However, even with all the great perks of the internet, there are also problems that Bush couldn't quite predict in his essay. One of the biggest problems today that we hear in the news often is about the misuses of data privacy especially in big corporations like Facebook. When we want to monetize people's data and information, people's privacies are invaded and that's exactly what Berners Lee fears and writes about in his essay. I agree with his point that we have to proceed cautiously when developing the word wide web to make sure that technology continues to be the powerful engine of innovations and communication that Bush imagined it to be and not spiral into a dark hole of infringing on human rights. I think it's quite scary to let others have access to your private information, and if I'm hearing many stories about this topic today, I can only imagine how much worse it'll grow in the future if this trend continues. It was interesting to read these two essays and compare these two different points of time, as one writer is from the past, predicting this emerging technology, while the other essay was written in the present, discussing the problems and mishaps that result from this technology.</p> <br>
