			<!-- Info from https://www.psychicsofa.ca/article/popular-fortune-telling-methods-from-around-the-world-->
			<p> The traditional Hindu and Vedic system of astrology, known as Jyotish is a form of astrology that examines the position of the stars and planets in order to determine the past, present and future. The word "jyotish" translates to "the wisdom of the Heavens" and focuses on the alignment of the stars to explore personal strengths, challenges and destiny. Unlike Western astrology, Jyotish is based on the fixed, observable positions of the constellations. The astrologer will calculate the positions of the celestial bodies and planets, based on the day, date and time of your birth.</p>
