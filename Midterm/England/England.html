			<!-- Info from https://www.tokenrock.com/explain-scrying-89.html-->
			<p> Scrying is the ancient act of divination for the purpose receiving information. The act of scrying is usually achieved by concentrating on, or staring at an object containing a shiny surface (mostly crystal balls) until a vision is reached. The information may come through in the form of images, symbols or scenes. Scrying comes from the Old English word descry meaning "to make out dimly" or "to reveal." Scrying has its ancient origins coming from just about every corner of the globe, however, the revived European interest in scrying can be primarily traced between the medieval and renaissance period when new interest in magical philosophy began springing up.</p>
