				<h1>About Avere Valley</h1>
				<p>Seeing a white deer is a message that you are on a path of growth and expansion that will lead you in a direction beyond your wildest dreams.<br><br>
				Since I was a little kid, I was always fascinated by the concept of fortune telling and its different mediums from crystal balls to palm-reading. Combining my passion for graphic design and fascination for fortune telling, I bring Avere Valley, a digital fortune telling experience incorporated with hand-drawn graphics. "Avere" means "fortune and wealth" in Romanion, and this project is a "Valley" that explores different types of fortune telling from all around the world. So come along for a soothing and immersive ride.</p>
