			<!-- Info from https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-fortune-telling/-->
			<p> Omikuji (sacred lot) are fortunes written on rolled strips of paper. You can find these at shrines and temples throughout Japan. The traditional way of receiving an omikuji is by taking a bamboo container that's filled with small sticks, and shaking it until the first stick falls out. Each stick is numbered, and a priest or priestess will then select an omikuji that corresponds with the numbered stick that has fallen from your bamboo container.
			The origin of Omikuji today can date back to Buddhist priest of Enryakuji Temple at Mt. Hiei, Ryogen also known as Ganzan Daishi (912-985). Ryogen is known to be someone who could use super-natural power.</p>
